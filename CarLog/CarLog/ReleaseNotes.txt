My Car Log allows you to track basic information about your car, when you refuel, and keep a history of your service events. In addition to keeping track of when you refuel your car, it will display useful information about those transactions (e.g. Miles per Gallon) and provides an overall summary of your vehicle's performance including total costs for several different time periods.

My Car Log supports multiple vehicles and provides an individual summary of events for each car. Distances can be tracked in either Miles or Kilometers and quantity of fuel can be tracked in either gallons or liters.
